## 🛠 Development Process  

### 1️⃣ Understanding the Problem  
The project started by identifying gaps in current AR/VR wearables. Research was conducted to understand:  
- The limitations of existing wearable devices in terms of usability, accessibility, and functionality.  
- The need for **emotion-adaptive environments**, **gesture-based controls**, and **seamless real-world integration**.  
- How **AR/VR can enhance health, fitness, and productivity** with **real-time biometric tracking**.  

### 2️⃣ Brainstorming Ideas  
- A **morphological analysis** was conducted to systematically explore feature combinations.  
- The **SCAMPER technique** was used to refine and improve ideas.  
- Multiple **wireframes and UI concepts** were sketched to visualize how users would interact with the system.  

### 3️⃣ Research & References  
- **Studied existing AR/VR devices** (Meta Quest, HoloLens, Apple Vision Pro) to analyze strengths and weaknesses.  
- **Explored UI/UX trends** in wearable tech to design an intuitive interface.  
- **Reviewed neuroscience & biometric research** to integrate real-time emotion detection.  

### 4️⃣ Prototyping  
- Designed interactive UI/UX **in Figma**, focusing on ease of use and immersion.  
- Created a **storyboard** in **Canva** to visualize user interactions step by step.  
- Developed a **morphological chart** to evaluate feature combinations and select the most innovative solutions.  

### 5️⃣ Refinement & Testing  
- Adjusted features based on feedback and **ensured a smooth user experience**.  
- Simulated interactions in Figma to check usability and workflow efficiency.  
- Documented the entire process, including **idea generation, testing, and iteration**.
